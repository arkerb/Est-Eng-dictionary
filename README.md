# Estonian-English Dictionary

This project is created using Vue Js and Bootstrap 4.

The application uses localstorage so make sure your browser supports it.

##Short explanation:

The app uses 2 dictionaries to save words and their translation.
Once a translation is submitted it is saved in both dictionaries.

Example:

"Tool - Chair" into the Estonian Dictionary and "Chair - Tool" into the English Dictionary
